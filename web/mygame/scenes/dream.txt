You are having a dream. You know it's a dream because...
*choice
	#You just tried to pinch yourself.
		*goto pinchself
	#You have developed the skill of lucid dreaming.
		*set lucid_dreamer true
		*goto luciddream
	#On second thought, is this a dream?
		*set good_imagination true
		*goto notdream

*label pinchself
How hard did you pinch yourself?
*choice
	#Not very hard.
		*goto pinchsoft
	#As hard as I could!
		*goto pinchhard

*label pinchsoft
Yup, sure enough, when you pinch yourself, it feels numb and not as painful as real life.

You are definitely dreaming. What do you see?
*label dream1
*choice
	#A veil of mist.
		*goto dreamveil
	#A city street at night after a rain.
		*goto dreamcity
	#The deep woods.
		*goto dreamwoods

*label dreamveil
You are standing at the edge of a small clearing, and the grass is cool and wet under your bare feet.

From the mist emerges a figure.
*choice
	#The figure appears male.
		*set c1g "Male"
		*set c1n "Aurion"
		*set c1p "he"
		*set c1o "his"
		*set c1t "him"
	#The figure appears female.
		*set c1g "Female"
		*set c1n "Aria"
		*set c1p "she"
		*set c1o "her"
		*set c1t "her"

"Hello, Dreamwalker," the figure smiles, stopping perhaps twenty feet away. "My name is ${c1n}," ${c1p} says. "We have been waiting for you..."
*choice
	#This is too strange! Try to wake up.
		*comment better real world advantages
		*goto refusecall
	#Ask why they have been waiting for you.
		*comment most cooperative, fastest route, most info, less real world advantages, but more connection to the other realm (but is it a trick?)
		*goto askwhy
	#Ask who they are.
		*comment neutral, neither advantage but less likely to be trickable
		*goto askwho

*label refusecall
The dream starts to fade, and ${c1n} starts to approach, ${c1o} brow creased.

"Do not go," ${c1p} says, ${c1o} voice urgent. "You are in danger! Come back!"

But it's too late. You wake up, and though at first you're a little concerned about what ${c1p} said, as you go about your day, like most dreams, it fades from your mind.

What did you do this day?
*label setprofession
*choice
	#Run your successful entrepreneurial business.
		[to do]
	#Kick back, just chillin'.
		[to do]
	#Go to school.
		[to do]

[Maybe can have good or bad day. Then...]

You go to bed, and you have another dream except this time it's a NIGHTMARE!

				*goto tellname
		"No. WHO are you?" ${c1n} asks, ${c1o} brow creasing.

		Before you can answer. The dream begins to fade.

		You wake up. It's a bright, cheery morning, and the sun is shining in your window.

		Despite all this, you feel troubled. Who was this person and what did they want? Why did ${c1p} say they were waiting for you?

You are dreaming you are running in terror from something horrible.

It is...

	#A wild animal.

*label chasepresence
You are in the deep woods, but you are comfortable here, for it's the only home you've ever known.

Your bare feet move so fast they are a blur as you dash over the uneven ground, and you fear neither stick nor stone, for your feet always find a safe place to land.

You need no path. You prefer the brambles, but now, something has invaded the sanctity of the domain in which you and your people once reigned unchallenged.

You are a werewolf!

Suddenly, you wake up. It's morning. Dawn's early sunlight floods cheerily through your window, and all seems right with the world... except... what the heck was up with that dream???

Shuddering, you try to put it out of your mind. You get out of bed and look about your room.

You are generally able to instantly recognize when you're lucid dreaming.

Once this happens, you can decide what you want to do, but you don't have the ability to actually change your surroundings or what's happening just by willing it yet.
